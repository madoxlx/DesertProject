I'm building a modern, responsive **travel booking website** for a Middle Eastern tourism agency and I need clean, semantic HTML structure for both the **filter system** and the **homepage layout**. The project includes five core services: Flights, Hotels, Visas, Trips, and Packages — each with its own filter group.

Please generate semantic HTML markup with these requirements:

### 🎨 Design & UI Guidelines:
Design a modern, responsive travel booking website UI for a Middle Eastern tourism agency.

- The homepage should feature:
  - A vibrant **hero section** with a scenic background image (e.g., pyramids or beach).
  - Overlaid clean **search interface** including filters:
    - Destination Country
    - City
    - Trip Type
    - Number of Nights
    - Budget
  - **Tabs** at the top allow switching between:
    - ✈️ Flights
    - 🏨 Hotels
    - 🛂 Visas
    - 🌍 Trips
    - 📦 Packages

  - Each tab dynamically shows relevant filter fields for that service.
  - Below the hero section, show:
    - Featured offers
    - Recommended destinations
    - Popular travel packages in large cards with images, ratings, and prices

- Color palette:
  - White backgrounds
  - Royal Blue accents (#2a6dfc)
  - Subtle shadows
  - Smooth rounded UI elements
  - Clean, readable **sans-serif typography**

- Design principles:
  - Lots of white space
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Icons for sections: ✈️, 🏨, 🛂, 🌍, 📦

- Footer should include:
  - Contact info
  - Social media links
  - Quick access to: Blog, Terms, and Support

### 🧠 Structure Requirements:

1. Generate a clean homepage layout:
   - Header with logo + navigation links
   - Hero section with scenic background
   - Tabs for switching between filters (use <nav> or <ul>)
   - Filters area for each service (see below)
   - Results area placeholder (e.g., <div class="results">)
   - Footer with contact and links

2. Group each filter inside a <section> or <div class="card"> with clear titles and labels.

3. Use semantic tags where applicable (header, main, section, footer, etc.)

4. No styling or scripts needed — just clean HTML with good structure, comments, and accessibility in mind.
